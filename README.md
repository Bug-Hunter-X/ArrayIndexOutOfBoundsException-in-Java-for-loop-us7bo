# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that produces this exception. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

The bug arises from incorrect loop indexing when iterating over an array. The solution shows the correct way to iterate and avoid the exception.

This example is useful for understanding common coding errors and how to debug them.
